    <p id="myPara"> Pardon me if I bore you with this initial prose, but that is the point. 
        I'm the primary audience here and I want to be bored. 
        Its major selling point to me is to be able to take a step back, look into a thing not from a myopic lens, 
        and backtrack into thinking what exactly is the point of this all. It often serves as a humbling 
        reminder about the things you don't know (unknown unknown → known unknown).
